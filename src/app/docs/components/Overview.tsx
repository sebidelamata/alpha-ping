                    AlphaPING is an aggregated social trading platform that combines real-time chat, data analysis, project research, and trading in a single application. It is designed to foster a transparent and engaging community of traders, researchers, and enthusiasts, while filtering out spam and bots. Users gain access by minting a ERC-721 membership token. Token holdings and balances are recorded and displayed alongside each userâ€™s posts, helping establish transparency and discouraging fraudulent activities. Integrated with the 1Inch Router, AlphaPING ensures users can execute trades at optimal rates without needing to exit the platform.
